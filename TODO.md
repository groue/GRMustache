- [ ] #97: In commit 65a6593229ae8bad1630a82ccebb327fb4a9f1e3, Daniel removes a few tests based on Core Data. Make sure that we still have tests for Core Data: attributes are safe keys, and they should be rendered.
- [X] See if dropping GRMustacheSafeKeyAccess and introducing GRMustacheObject could not solve two issues at the same time:
    - [X] #66
    - [X] Compatibility with GRMustache.swift on Arrays, Sets, and other standard collections.
    - [X] Drop GRMustacheSafeKeyAccess
    - [X] Drop default support for objectForKeyedSubscript:
    - [X] Add GRMustacheKeyValueCoding
- [X] Share JSON tests suite with GRMustache.swift.
    - [X] Use submodule
    - [X] Arrays should only have "count", "first" and "last" keys.
    - [X] Sets should only have "count", and "first" keys.
- [X] Remove standard library from default context.
- [X] Drop +[GRMustache standardLibrary]
- [X] Drop deprecated items:
    - [X] GRMustacheTagTypeInvertedSection
    - [X] +[GRMustache renderingObjectForObject:]
    - [X] +[GRMustache renderingObjectWithBlock:]
    - [X] GRMustacheTag.templateRepository
- [X] Drop GRMustacheVersion and +[GRMustache libraryVersion]
- [X] Dynamic partial overrides `{{# partial }}...{{/ partial }}`
- [X] Check that {{ string.length }} is correctly implemented (NSObject+GRMustacheKeyValueCoding.m) and tested (https://github.com/groue/GRMustacheSpec).
- [X] Remove @synthesize and explicit ivars in headers
- [X] Turn -[GRMustacheKeyValueCoding valueForMustacheKey:] into -[GRMustacheKeyValueCoding hasValue:forMustacheKey:]. This prevents making NSNull a magic value.
- [X] Drop support for unsafe contexts. GRMustacheKeyValueCoding is there if one wants to escape default behavior.

- [?] Drop support for else `{{#a}}{{^a}}{{/a}}`.
- [?] Have Filter and renderingObject APIs closer from GRMustache.swift
- [?] Import "register" vocabulary from GRMustache.swift, instead of "protected objects".
- [?] ARC. Since GRMustache 8 is all about framework and targetting iOS8+ and OSX10.9+, there is no longer any reason for manual memory management.
